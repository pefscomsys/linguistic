                                In the Poems: <strong><i>Stir it Up, the smile in you and celebrate,</i></strong> the author is like complaining to teachers, parents
                                and all that creative writing in verse and prose is not being given the prominence it enjoyed some time ago.</p> <p>Thus, there is urgency to 
                                wake up (stir up), read and enjoy Akombi's Poems then write yours and celebrate what you are capable of.

		   Akombi's poems talk about ordinary things: soup, robbery, corruption, hills, parents, love, fish, foofoo, the gap between your teeth, popcorn, crying babies, and more.
		   It's as if to tell the children of this age that <strong><i>"you are the children of the universe, look around you and create from things around you to prove that you are, 
 that you belong to the universe and can be remembered in it through poetry".</i></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		   Another element in Sammy Okombi's book which we find interesting is the nurturing of patriotic awareness in the minds. This is particularly useful for a country like ours 
		   which prides on bilingualism, multilingualism, multitribalism and multiculturalism. In this kind of situation, the rallying point is nationalism. nurturing mind to be 
           nationalistic is clearly observed in points like: <strong><i> Land of my birth, My Commitment, Hope of a nation, Patriot etc.</i></strong>
