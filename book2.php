                               Corruption is endemic in Cameroon. Twice, Transparency International has accorded the country the infamous first place in corruption. As one 
                               of many concerned Cameroonians, Sammy Oke Akombi was moved and then realized that something was infact wrong somewhere and something has to be 
                               done somewhere.</p>

                                  This collection of short stories is his contribution to the collective resolve to the concerned Cameroonians to wage a war against this most
                                  "unusual friend of fairness". The story seek to elicit awareness about the social ill that is ironically championed by the very politicians, functionaries,
                                  educators, leaders and power elite whose duty it is to society healthy and on the rails. The stories are on corruption on different segments of society and about 
								  the people who perpetrate it.

							<p>
							  Almost everyone is immersed in it and so must make every effort to resurface from it. It takes only the will to say alive because the wages of corruption like any other sin can only be death.
